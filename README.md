# AIRMARTIN-find East Africa's unique homes in one place
![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/YNFM9PX.jpg)
> East Africa is endowed with many tourist attractions ranging from unique culture, wild game, and beautiful scenery. These natural endowments have attracted tourists from all over the world who have brought lots of profit to the economy, mainly through foreign exchange, but unfortunately, many locals have not been able to get a decent share of this revenue. AirMartin is a modern platform for East Africans to list their local properties at a lower cost so tourists can find a home to stay in at a cost.

## General Information

How can East Africans leverage tourism to improve the lives of the less privileged in their communities? While East Africa is known for its unique natural resources and hospitable communities, the people-local communities- who should benefit from the fruits of the tourism sector have not. This is because there is no well know home booking site that lists homes of the local communities. The well-known booking sites only list the homes of hotels and motels in the region, making it hard for local entrepreneurs who would like to join the hospitality industry. Additionally, the available home booking web apps do not support mobile money payment gateways, which are the most prominently used in the region. 

AirMartin seeks to create a modern home booking web application that empowers local communities to list their properties at lower prices so tourists can find them. The UI/UX of this application is very simple for the local communities to navigate. AirMartin, we also have a mobile application that will allow users-guest&host- to have a unique experience while using the service. We understand that most of the phones in East Africa are feature phones, so we hope to create a USSD-based home booking application connected to AirMartin so that more local people who do not have access to the internet can get an opportunity to list their properties online. 

To this end, it is clear that AirMartin gains pride in leading the race to increase the monthly income of   East Africans. At AirMartin, we radiate economic inclusion!  are no standards
